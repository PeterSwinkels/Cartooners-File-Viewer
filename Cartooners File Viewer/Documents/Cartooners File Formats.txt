******
The frame rate's range is 0.2 to 60.0 frames per second. The formula for calculating the number of frames per second:
Rate = (1000 / [Header:0x26]) / (1000 / 60.0)

60.0	  = The highest frame rate supported .
1000 / 60 = The minimum number of milliseconds between frames supported.

Notes:
1. The units are such that a rate of 0x3C steps per second is represented as 0xD6 = 0x4000. Lower rates can be obtained by linear scaling: for 0x1E steps/second, rate = 0x2000.
2. If the first bit is 0x01, the colors should cycle, otherwise this color register range is inactive and should have no effect.
   If the last bit is 0x00, the colors cycle upwards.
   I.e. each color moves into the next index position in the color map and the uppermost color in the range moves down to the lowest position.
   If the last bit is 0x01, the colors cycle in the opposite direction. Only those colors between the low and high entries in the color map should cycle.

[Decompression]
Steps for decompression:

1. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the decompressed data's length equals or exceeds the number of horizontal pixels or the end of the file is reached.
2. Read one byte from the file.
3. If its value is 0x00-0x7F, then the byte represents the number of bytes (plus one) following it. These should be read from the file and added to the compressed data.
   If its value is 0x81-0xFF, then the byte represents the number of times (minus 0x100) the following byte should be repeated and added to the compressed data.
4. Go to step 1.

All the compressed data combined will contain the bitplanes representing an image.

Notes:
1. Although this file format can have various extensions in its file name and can contain various types of IFF records, only the *.lbm extension and the "BMHD", "BODY", and "CMAP" record types are described here.
2. Compressed pixel data must be decompressed before the data in the bitplanes can be processed.
3. Each column of bitplane data should be [BMHD:0x00] / [BMHD:0x0C] of bytes in width.
4. Even when Cartooners is running in VGA (320x200 pixels with 256 colors) all images are automatically downgraded to 16 colors.
